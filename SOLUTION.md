  - Invoice number and customer name
  - Amount with proper currency formatting
  - Due date and days overdue calculation
  - Current status with color-coded indicators
  - Assigned team member
  - Last updated timestamp

#### Advanced Filtering & Sorting

- **Multi-criteria Filtering**:
  - Status-based filtering (draft, sent, paid, overdue, cancelled)
  - Amount range filtering (min/max values)
  - Days overdue filtering (1+, 7+, 30+, 60+, 90+ days)
  - Assigned user filtering
  - Text search across invoice number and customer name
- **Smart Sorting**: Click any column header to sort by that field (ascending/descending)
- **Clear Filters**: One-click option to reset all filters

#### Status Management

- **Real-time Status Updates**: Dropdown selectors in the table for instant status changes
- **Status Validation**: Proper status transitions with visual feedback
- **Color-coded Status Indicators**: Each status has distinct colors for quick identification
